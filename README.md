# Genesys Cloud Data Table Manager

This is a simple tool I built to help manage Genesys Cloud Data Tables. It makes it easier to edit rows, manage who can see or change what, and keep track of changes.

## What it does

*   **Manage Users**: You can create users and give them Admin or User roles.
*   **Permissions**: You can decide exactly which tables or columns a user can read or write.
*   **Edit Data**: Add, update, or delete rows in your Data Tables easily.
*   **Search**: Quickly find the data you need.
*   **Backup**: Save your tables to a JSON file and restore them later if needed.
*   **Environments**: Switch between different Genesys organizations (like Dev, Test, Prod) without restarting.
*   **Audit Logs**: Keeps a history of who changed what.
*   **Rollback Functionality**: Functionality to Undo the changes.


## Business Process Overview

This workflow demonstrates how the application bridges the gap between Business Users and Genesys Cloud, ensuring security and compliance.

## How to run it

### Windows
Just double-click the **`run.bat`** file.
*   It will create a central environment in `C:\PilviContactCenter`.
*   It will install all necessary libraries.
*   It will open the app in your default browser automatically.

### macOS / Linux
1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Make the script executable (first time only):
    ```bash
    chmod +x run.sh
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```
*   It will create a central environment in `~/PilviContactCenter`.
*   It will install all necessary libraries.
*   It will open the app in your default browser automatically.

### The manual way
If you prefer the command line:
1.  Install the requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Run the app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## First Run & Setup

Since version 2.0, the application includes a **Setup Wizard** for the initial configuration. You no longer need to use default credentials.

1.  **Launch the App**: Run `run.bat` (Windows) or `./run.sh` (Mac/Linux).
2.  **Create Admin User**: On the first run, you will be prompted to create your **Administrator Account** (Email & Password).
3.  **Connect Genesys Cloud**: You can optionally enter your Genesys Cloud Client ID, Client Secret, and Region during setup, or configure it later in the Admin Panel.

Once setup is complete, simply log in with the credentials you just created.

## Utility Scripts

The project includes several utility scripts for debugging and inspection (e.g., `inspect_row.py`, `check_schema.py`).
These scripts have been updated to be interactive. When you run them, they will prompt you to enter the **Table ID** you wish to inspect, making them safe and easy to use across different organizations.

## Notes

*   The app uses a local database file (`genesys_manager.db`) to store users and settings.
*   If you use this in a real production environment, make sure to change the secret key in the code.

Enjoy!

## Database Schema

        Integer id PK
        String email
        String password
        String role
    }

    AppConfig {
        Integer id PK
        String name
        String client_id
        String client_secret
        String region
        Boolean is_active
    }

    TablePermission {
        Integer id PK
        Integer user_id FK
        String table_id
        Boolean can_update_rows
        Boolean can_read_rows
    }

    ColumnPermission {
        Integer id PK
        Integer table_permission_id FK
        String column_name
        String access_level
    }

    AuditLog {
        Integer id PK
        Integer user_id FK
        String action
        String target
        Text details
        Text previous_state
        Text new_state
        DateTime timestamp
    }

    User ||--o{ TablePermission : "has"
    User ||--o{ AuditLog : "generates"
    TablePermission ||--o{ ColumnPermission : "contains"
